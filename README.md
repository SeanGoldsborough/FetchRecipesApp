### Summary: An app that displays a collection of recipes from around the world.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas? 
Imagine caching and async network calls to optimize app performance and network data usage.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time? 
Approximately 4hrs. 

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
Default sorting recipes by country in alphabetical order. Included detail view for each recipe. Included debug screen to easily simulate network calls returning incomplete data and empty data.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I would like to later revisit and expand the sorting options and UI design.
